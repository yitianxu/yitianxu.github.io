### Daily Learning [(日积跬步)](https://yitianxu.github.io/2017/01/05/learning-summary)

```
If you use pushd and popd instead of cd you won't get that UNC error.
pushd <UNC path> will create a temporary virtual drive and get into it.
popd will delete the temporary drive and get you back to the path you were when you entered pushd.
Example:
C:\a\local\path> pushd \\network_host\a\network\path
U:\a\network\path> REM a temporary U: virtual drive has been created
U:\a\network\path> popd
C:\a\local\path> REM the U: drive has been deleted
C:\a\local\path>

```
